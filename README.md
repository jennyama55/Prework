## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Spotify: 
- The recommendation of new songs similar to those I usually listen to
- Ability to follow people I know and see what they're listening to and view their playlists

DoorDash:
- Categories make it easy to narrow down places that I might be interested in getting
- Provides good summary of each place -- with rating, distance, time it'd take, and potential deals

Snapchat:
- Easily send photos/videos without taking up storage
- Filters

Google Calendar
- Customize colors of events
- Can be shared amongst multiple people

My app idea would provide people with a way to decide what to do with a group of people or by themselves. It would start with a short questionnaire in which you answer questions about if you're doing an activity alone or in a group, what kind of mood you're in, and how much you're willing to spend, etc. If doing it alone, it will then show you Tinder-style like recommendations of activities or places to go, with increasing specificity. By swiping left and right, and indicating a yes or no, the app will determine the best recommendations to show next until it has made a definite decision on what you should do. If doing an activity in a group, a group code will be generated, allowing all members of the group to go through the swiping, with their answers being combined, and the app will return a final decision based on the entire groups' answers.
